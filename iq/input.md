    - "question": "Can you talk about CI/CD?",
    - "answer": "<p>KeyPoints:</p><ol><li>CICD is continuous integration and continuous deployment. In the project, we usually use Jenkins with its pipeline scripts to implement CICD. </li><li>The script contains multiple parts. The `stages` parts list each stage and the steps inside. For example, stage one is `checkout` and steps in this stage are like using git clone to checkout the code from repository and then use maven to package it etc.  Another part of the script is `post` part which handles different result. For example, what to do when the build is success or failure, what to do when the test cases failed etc. </li><li>CICD usually starts from when the code is pushed to the target branch, and then it includes checkout and package the code, deploy the jar/war, run the test cases and send reports etc. It could cover from dev to QA/Staging environment, but usually does not cover production.</li></ol>",

    - "question": "Key Difference: Soap vs Rest",
    - "answer": 
        - **SOAP** is a protocol that defines a set of rules for structuring messages. It has strict standards and typically operates over HTTP but can also use other protocols like SMTP, FTP, etc.
	    - **REST** is an architectural style that uses existing protocols (primarily HTTP) and is more flexible and lightweight. It focuses on resources and their representations.,
