<p>Which of the following statements is true about RIP?<br>This type of question contains radio buttons and checkboxes for selection of options. Use Tab for navigation and Enter or space to select the option.<br>A</p>
<p>Since it has a maximum allowable hop count of 20 by default, a hop count of 21 would be deemed unreachable.<br>B</p>
<p>Since it has a maximum allowable hop count of 18 by default, a hop count of 19 would be deemed unreachable.<br>C</p>
<p>Since it has a maximum allowable hop count of 16 by default, a hop count of 17 would be deemed unreachable.<br>D</p>
<p>Since it has a maximum allowable hop count of 15 by default, a hop count of 16 would be deemed unreachable.<br>ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö</p>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>C ‚Äî Since it has a maximum allowable hop count of 16 by default, a hop count of 17 would be deemed unreachable. ‚úÖ</p>
<p>Explanation:<br>RIP (Routing Information Protocol) uses hop count as its routing metric. The protocol defines:</p>
<p>Maximum hop count = 15</p>
<p>Any destination with a hop count of 16 is considered unreachable</p>
<p>So if a route‚Äôs hop count exceeds 16 (i.e., 17), RIP will treat it as unreachable. This is a fundamental limit designed to prevent routing loops.</p>
<p>Option D is a common distractor because it flips the numbers, but RIP‚Äôs limit is 15 hops.</p>
